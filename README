JavaSnake

This is my first attempt at developing a 2D Java game.  I intend to use this project in my portfolio
to assist in job searching once I graduate from Western Carolina University.  Because this is my
first attempt I am expecting a great number of struggles but I will do my best to create an
optimized, well-run project that follows good coding practices.  Any thoughts, critiques, advice,
or questions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for taking the time to look through my
repository.
